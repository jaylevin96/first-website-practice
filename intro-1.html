<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Welcome to my first website! I am currently enrolled (or soon to be) in App Academy's online bootcamp program. As part of the prepwork to make sure I am ready for
        day one, I've been tasked with creating my first website using some of the tools I've learned on my own these past few weeks. I've decided to use these pages to demonstrate my knowledge thus far
        and tell you a little bit about my career, professional growth, and hobbies.
    </p>

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<div>
<p>
    I graduated University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign in May of 2019 with a double major in Information Systems and Marketing. After graduation I pursued a career within the technology consulting space.
</p>
<p>
    I first worked for RSM within their Microsoft Dynamics 365 Delivery practice. Microsoft Dynamics 365 is a cloud-based ERP system that essentially offers finance and supply chain solutions for midsize companies. As a technology consultant, it was my responsibility
    to be the "expert" of this system and be a functional owner of some areas/modules (Accounts payable, Accounts receivable, inventory management, procurement, etc.) Our projects would consist of our team understanding our clients business and helping them transition from some legacy system to Microsoft Dynamics.
</p>
<p>
    As part of these implementations I would help lead any required software development that needed to be done to D365 to support our clients business. I would draft functional and technical design documents to outline new kinds of functionality: new fields, tables, or much more complex features and integrations with other business applications.

    </p>
    Fast forward a few years and I have decided that it would be best for myself to pursue a more technical career outside of the D365/ERP space. After a lot of research I decided that a coding bootcamp would be the best fit for me in order to prepare me for this career change. I've always taken an interest in coding
    where I had taken a handful of classes in college around SQL, R, and Java, but I have yet to make the full commitment. I am very excited for this next journey with App Academy.

<h2>Hobbies and Personal interests</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        In my free time you can find me playing Chess (check out the links page to add me if you ever want to play!), video games, or working out regularly. I used to run all the time but I like to label myself as a seasonal runner these days to avoid the Chicago cold.

        I grew up playing tennis for years but these days I play racquetball every week and have also enjoyed picking up pickleball. In the winter I have gotten into skiing and over the summer you can find me on North ave beach playing some volleyball!
